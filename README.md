Little elm sandbox fun and experimentation

**Updated for v0.19.0** of Elm

> **Side Note** It is very broken right now, I am in the middle of re factoring how a lot of this works which requires me to rethink the process of each experiement

## Usage

- cd into a small app (Each folder is its own app)
- run `elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.html`
- open the newly generated html file

## Reactor and play

- cd into repo folder
- run `elm reactor`
- go to `loclhost:port` (8000 by default)
- click on the small app you want to see `Main.elm`
- watch it compile and play!
